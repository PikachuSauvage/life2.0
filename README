The idea is to see if there can be evolution of a genome to match a given profile of gene expression without affecting the gene sequences or prometers
The mutations would then only affect gene expression through the modulation of supercoiling


TO DO:
-implement a function that take a genome and its fitness, create a new genome by mutations, run a simulation on it, compute its fitness and return either the old or the new genome according to their fitnesses
-implement a function that makes random inversions in the genome
-implement a function that makes random insertion/deletion in the genome
-implement a function that compute the fitness given the results of a simulation and a target profile of gene expression
